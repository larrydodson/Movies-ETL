# Movies-ETL
## UTMCC DataViz Module 8

## Overview and Purpose

  In preparation for a Hackathon, we helped Britta create a clean dataset. Data was collected from Wikipedia and Kaggle, then combined into a new SQL database. The hackathon participants will use this dataset during the event. The ETL process was used to extract data from files and transform the datasets using Python Pandas by joining, then the clean dataset was loaded into a SQL database. 

### Purpose
   Creating a reliable, clean dataset of movies data to be analyzed by groups of programmers during an upcoming hackathon.


### Resources
  * Data sources: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
  * Software: Windows10, Python 3.8.3, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL 12, pgAdmin4 4.24
